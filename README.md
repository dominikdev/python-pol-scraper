Python Scraper
==============
This is just a script i wrote to aid me with my political application that i'm developing. I had never used python before this, but i was able to put it together in a couple of hours. It scrapers "ontheissues.org" for presidental canidate quotes on top political issues then stores them in a mongodb database that is local for now.
